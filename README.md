### :man_technologist: About Me :

My wife calls me a unicorn.  

***I make a friend everywhere I go‚ùó***  Living in rural North Carolina for my first 12 years gave me the kind, witty, hospitable southern charm that makes me approachable and easy to talk to.  ***I'm empathetic‚ùó***  Moving across the country to Central California at the transformative age of 13 gave me a totally new perspective. **I know how to work hard and play hard.**  Moving to Las Vegas at 21 to attend UNLV full-time and work full-time taught me the importance of finding balance in all situations. **I'm a retro gaming and horror movie nerd.**  I'm in the middle of transforming my den with the ultimate gaming and movie theater set-up.

Currently, I manage the operations for one of the busiest Nike stores on Earth -- no, really, it's in the top 5.  We sell t-shirts and sneakers to people visiting Las Vegas from all over world at a pace that can be difficult to imagine without seeing it for yourself. It's an amazingly fun thrill has taught me an immense amount, but I'm looking for a change.

My wife works in the airline industry and we dream of a life full of travel.  In effort to turn those dreams into reality, I up-skilled/re-skilled/polished my existing tech skills by earning a Business Intelligence Analyst Certificate from TripleTen making remote work (and more travel) possible. 

### What I'm working on :

* I'm currently working on fine-tuning my job search artifacts and job search plan with TripleTen's Career Coaches!
* I've completed seven Business Intelligence Analyst Projects within TripleTen's program.

### Top Skills :
* Data Visualization
* Data Analysis
* Tableau
* Power BI
* SQL
* Google Sheets
